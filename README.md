# Condenser
Condenser: a contrived demonstration of automated creation of EC2 instances (AWS VMs) using the AWS Python API boto3 for core functionality, and Terraform for creation and management of the VPC and its contents. This could be extended to shorten the elapsed time of a compute-intensive workload by breaking it into chunks, each chunk computed by one of the VMs. There are better ways to do this; this project is just a demonstration.
